# DeRivean

![Build](https://github.com/marek-hanzal/DeRivean/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Legacy of DeRivean as the game (server) engine.

## Welcome!

This project is my main personal work to play with Kotlin and React and try to do stuff as good as possible - thus making this piece of software showcase of my abilities

Server is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) / [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed), client is using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux Store](https://redux.js.org/api/store)
, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and for me the best UI,
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

Goal is simple: create a game with REST API, administration module and simple text client as I'm not graphic designer. In shiny world of Unicorns, this enabled possibility to implement alternative clients for the game, for example one with
nice graphics.

## About

Long time ago there was DeRivean Engine, before all Unitys and Unreals and other cool stuff today. Then I've moved to web development making the original Engine obsolete (yep, does not make sense when there are really cool things from Epic
and other brave brothers in arms), so that's reason for the name
`Legacy of DeRivean` as it was the original project which gave me initial power of programming.

### Sidenote

Current development version (lowest milestone) is in master; closed milestones are in respective branches.
